## üß† Hacking Outscale SDK

The SDK used in this project is **generated automatically** using [Outscale's COGNAC](https://github.com/outscale/COGNAC) tool and the [osc-api](https://github.com/outscale/osc-api) specification.

This means:

- **Pull requests that change the generated SDK code will be overwritten** the next time we regenerate from `osc-api`.
- If you want to improve the underlying SDK, consider opening an issue or PR directly in [osc-sdk-c](https://github.com/outscale/osc-sdk-c) instead.

We **do** welcome contributions such as:

- Feature suggestions
- CLI examples
- Documentation improvements
- Tests and usage validation
