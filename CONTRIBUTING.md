# Hacking Outscale SDK

SDK itself is generated from Outscale's [COGNAC](https://github.com/outscale/COGNAC) using [osc-api](https://github.com/outscale/osc-api) description.

This mean that pull request providing change to code would be automatically overwritten in next [osc-api].

Other contributions like examples, issue and tests are welcome!
